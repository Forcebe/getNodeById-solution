Solution to a practice interview problem:

## Installation

Clone the repo into a folder. Run `npm init -y` then `npm install --save-dev jest`.

Check the `package.json` folder and make sure the `test` section under `scripts` reads

```javascript
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

then run `npm run test` and you should see that the tests are passing.
